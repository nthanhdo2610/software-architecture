# CS590 Software Architecture

Welcome to the SWA DE course that starts Monday June 24

Traditionally every software project has a dedicated software architect who designs the architecture for a certain system. In agile software development software architecture is not a role, but a task that is performed by the team members (developers).  In this course we study the important software architecture techniques, styles and patterns that are used in modern software systems.

First we will look at techniques and best practices to discover the architectural relevant requirements. Then we study how to design, evaluate and communicate architecture.

We will study many architectural styles like domain driven design, component based architecture, service oriented architecture, microservice architecture, event driven architecture and stream based architecture. We also study architecture patterns like event sourcing, CQRS, publish-subscribe, reactive, eventual consistency, integration patterns, API gateway, registry, token based security, etc.

We use Spring Boot, Spring Cloud and Kafka to practice the different architectural styles and patterns
